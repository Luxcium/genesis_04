# Custom instructions for GitHub Copilot

Always generate code that adheres to TypeScript best practices.

For any new feature, include appropriate unit tests in the `test` directory.

When generating commands in `src/extension.ts`, ensure they are registered correctly and follow the extension's functionality.

Use the types and interfaces defined in `src/types/index.ts` for type safety throughout the code.

Always include comments in the code to explain complex logic or important decisions.

For any generated README content, include installation instructions, usage examples, and contribution guidelines.

When updating the CHANGELOG, follow the format of listing the version number, date, and a brief description of changes.

Ensure that all code is formatted according to the project's coding standards and passes linting checks.
