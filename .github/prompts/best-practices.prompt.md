# Copilot Prompt: TypeScript & VS Code Best Practices

Your goal is to generate or review TypeScript code that:

- Adheres to TypeScript best practices.
- Uses types and interfaces from `src/types/index.ts` for type safety.
- Includes comments for complex logic or important decisions.
- Follows the coding standards and passes linting checks.
- Registers VS Code extension commands correctly in `src/extension.ts`.
- For new features, includes unit tests in the `test` directory.
- For documentation, includes installation, usage, and contribution guidelines.

**Self-Modification & Memory:**

- When updating this prompt, always preserve and build upon existing best practices.
- Reference `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for global standards.
- If new best practices emerge, add them here and in `copilot-instructions.md` to keep both in sync.
- Use Markdown links or #file:example.prompt.md references to provide additional context or examples.

**Example Reference:**

- [copilot-instructions.md](../copilot-instructions.md)

**Real-Time Learning:**

- If you notice a recurring improvement, update this prompt and the instructions file.
- Encourage contributors to suggest changes via pull requests.
